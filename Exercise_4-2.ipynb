One is a list of prices for different resorts per night, and the other is a list containing values of either 0 or 1, which represents whether it is possible to spot blacktip reef sharks in the vicinity of the resort.

For instance, if the first resort in the lists costs 230 USD per night and it has blacktip reef sharks in the surrounding beaches, the first data pair will be (230, 1).

    "Classes can have objects as attributes. For this exercise create a class called `Circle` containing a `center` and a `radius` as attributes. The `center` is represented by a `Point` object (previously defined in *Exercise 4*) and the `radius` by an *integer* value. These two attributes should get defined in the init method!\n",

    "- Class `Circle` represents a circle using a point as a center and a radius.\n",
